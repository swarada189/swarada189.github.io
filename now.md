This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), and it was inspired by [the /now movement](https://sivers.org/nowff). 

Currently, I'm on a mission to upgrade my skill set and hence been doing online courses.

And therefore I'm also doing mini-projects to test my understanding by applying the concepts I've learnt.

Soon, I'm planning to start deep learning specialization course. Maybe tomorrow? (pss saying this since last week) :wink:
